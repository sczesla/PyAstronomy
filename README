What is it?
-----------
  
  PyAstronomy is a collection of astronomy-related
  packages written in Python.
  
  Currently, the following subpackages are available:
    
    funcFit:    A convenient fitting package providing support
                for minimization and MCMC sampling.
                
    modelSuite: A Set of astrophysical models (e.g., transit
                light-curve modeling), which can be used
                stand-alone or with funcFit.
                 
    AstroLib:   A set of useful routines including a number
                of ports from IDL's astrolib.
                
    Constants:  The package provides a number of often-needed
                constants.
                
    Timing:     Provides algorithms for timing analysis such as
                the Lomb-Scargle and the Generalized Lomb-Scargle
                periodogram

Installation
------------

  Use "python setup.py [--with-ext] install"
  
  If you specify the --with-ext flag, setup will try to
  compile non-Python modules. This is not mandatory.
