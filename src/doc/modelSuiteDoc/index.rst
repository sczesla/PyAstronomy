The PyA model suite
========================

The PyAstronomy model suite is a set of implementations of physical models like,
for example, a transit light-curve model. The models are supposed to provide an
interface to the *funcFit* package so that they can be used for fitting. 

.. note:: We provide examples for the individual classes. For a more detailed introduction
          to the capabilities of the funcFit package, we refer to funcFit's tutorial.
