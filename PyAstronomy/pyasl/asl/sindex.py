        """
        Converting Mount-Wilson S-index into RHK index.

        The Mount-Wilson S-index is a measure of the flux in the emission-line cores
        of the Ca II H and K lines at about 3933 A and 3968 A in two
        narrow bands normalized by the flux in two adjacent continuum bands
        (3891.067-3911.069 A and 3991.067-4011.067 A).
        For technical reasons, the narrow bands have a triangular bandpass with
        a FWHM of 1.09 A (Vaughan et al. 1978). 

        The activity index RHK is closely related to the S-index. In
        particular, it gives the emission in the narrow bands normalized
        by the bolometric brightness of the star

        .. math::

            R_{HK} = \\frac{4\\pi R_s^2 (F_H + F_K)}{4\\pi R_s^2\\sigma T_{eff}^4} = \\frac{F_H+F_K}{\\sigma T_{eff}^4} \\; .

        The stellar surface flux in "arbitrary units" in the narrow
        H and K bands (fH + fK) is related to the Mount-Wilson S-index
        through the relation

        .. math::

            f_H + f_K = S C_{cf} T_{eff}^4 10^{-14} \\; ,

        where Ccf is a conversion factor, which can be parameterized in terms of
        the B-V color and the luminosity class. The conversion between
        arbitrary units and physical units, needed to derive the true surface
        flux and the RHK index, has been derived by several authors
        starting with Middelkoop 1982.
        Their factor was also used by Noyes et al. 1984---in particular in their
        appendix a, where is appears implicitly. Later, the value of the conversion
        factor has been revised by several authors, e.g., Oranje 1983 and Rutten 1984,
        who estimated a value about 70% larger than previously proposed. Hall et al.
        2007 derive a value 40% larger than that of Middelkoop 1982 and provide
        a thorough discussion on the differences between the individual approaches
        and results given in the literature.

        The RHK index thus derived still contains a contribution of photospheric
        flux in the narrow bands, which is always present and not related to the
        chromosphere. To obtain the purely chromospheric, primed RHK index,
        an estimate of the photospheric surface flux in the H and K pass-bands
        has to be subtracted. For active stars, the photospheric correction
        is usually quite irrelevant. For inactive, quiet stars, it can,
        however, be important.

        The issue of the Mount-Wilson S-index conversion has been revisited
        by Mittag et al. 2013, who provide an alternative conversion procedure
        and revised photospheric corrections for various luminosity classes. 

        .. note:: In the default configuration, the conversion of the S-index
                  into RHK is identical to the relation stated by Noyes et al. 1984
                  in their appendix (a)

                  .. math::

                      R_{HK} = 1.340 \\times 10^{-4} C_{cf} S

                  where the factor 1.34e-4 is a combination of the conversion from
                  arbitrary to physical units, 1e-14, and the Stefan-Boltzmann
                  constant, in particular 1.34e-4 = 7.6e5*1e-14/5.67e-5. The Ccf factor
                  is, however, calculated according to Rutten 1984.
